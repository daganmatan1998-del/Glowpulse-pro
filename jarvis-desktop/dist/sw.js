/* =====================================================================
   JARVIS — service worker
   =====================================================================

   Two jobs, and deliberately nothing else.

   It makes the app open instantly instead of re-downloading a 500KB page
   over a phone connection, and it caches the three.js files the hologram is
   built from. Those come from a CDN at runtime, which is fine on a desk and
   is the difference between an orb and a blank screen on a train — it is
   already written up as a known issue in the README, and this is the fix for
   the mobile case.

   What it must never do is touch the worker. Every reply, transcription,
   search and page read is a cross-origin POST to the backend, and a service
   worker that served any of those from cache would hand back yesterday's
   answer to today's question. Anything that is not a same-origin GET, or a
   GET of one of the CDN scripts, is passed straight through untouched.

   Bump SHELL_VERSION whenever dist/index.html changes, or phones will keep
   serving the copy they already have.
